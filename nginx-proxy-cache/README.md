# nginx-proxy-cache

A reverse proxy (NGINX) cache response from upstreams using [ngx_http_proxy_module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html).

## Architecture

```
NGINX (caching response)
`--- backend1 (Go HTTP app)
`--- backend2 (Go HTTP app)
```

## Development

Start containers:

```
make start
```

Then, send HTTP request to the nginx reverse proxy multiple times.

```
make ping-loop
```

You can notice that the following request will not be proxied to backend servers because the first response is cached.
